Update 1.02.2020
  -Most of the features are not going to be added, because of lack of intrest and not having anyone willing to develope
  
 -Known issues atm:

-Names, names, and more names (Udmurts, nenets etc, in common\cultures\00_cultures.txt)
-Map with fixed Ob river and ural mountains
-Culturally appropriate dynasty names (common\dynasties)
-Events and descisions from 0
  -Islamic Hajj changed to finno-ugric exploration to the north (not easy as it sounds, who ever bothers doing it)
   -Karhunpeijet
   -Bear pet?
   -more and more thematic events
-Make religion more interesting
   -assassin hash ritual into mushroom trip?
-Flags, change and make more
-Yugran expansion with new provinces, fix old borders and shit
-Fix history if you see anything weird
-Province names if anything is off
-Character birthdates if they are wrong, off, or too old
-Shawls on Finno-Ugric women
